# Federated Averaging (FedAvg) Implementation on CIFAR-10

This repository contains an implementation of the Federated Averaging (FedAvg) algorithm using the CIFAR-10 dataset. FedAvg is a federated learning technique designed to train a machine learning model collaboratively without requiring participants to share their data.

## Algorithm Overview

The Federated Averaging algorithm involves multiple clients (each with its own local dataset) that collaboratively train a global model. The process is coordinated by a central server and proceeds in rounds. Each round includes:

1. **Broadcasting**: The server sends the current global model to a subset of selected clients.
2. **Local Training**: Each client trains the model on its local data.
3. **Aggregation**: Clients send their model updates back to the server, which then averages these updates to improve the global model.

This approach allows for training on large, decentralized datasets, which enhances privacy and scalability.

## Implementation

The implementation is split into several Python scripts, each handling a part of the federated learning workflow:

- `helper.py`: Contains utility functions for loading and preprocessing the CIFAR-10 dataset and creating the model architecture using TensorFlow.
- `client.py`: Defines the `Client` class, which handles the local operations of data training and communication with the server.
- `server.py`: Implements the `Server` class that manages the overall federated learning process, including client coordination, model updating, and evaluation.
- `run_client.py`: A script to run the client-side operations, simulating the federated learning process.

### Technologies Used

- **Python**: For general programming.
- **TensorFlow**: For building and training the machine learning model.
- **Flask**: For creating a simple server to facilitate client-server communication.

## Execution Instructions

To run this project, follow these steps:

1. **Environment Setup**:
   - Ensure Python 3.x and pip are installed.
   - Install the required packages:
     ```bash
     pip install tensorflow flask numpy
     ```

2. **Running the Server**:
   - Start the server by running:
     ```bash
     python server.py
     ```
   - This will initiate the server and start listening for client connections.

3. **Running a Client**:
   - In a new terminal, start a client by running:
     ```bash
     python run_client.py
     ```
   - This script will simulate a client's participation in federated learning.

## Additional Notes

- Ensure network settings allow for client-server communication.
- Adjust the number of clients and federated rounds in the server script as needed for different experiments.
- This implementation is for educational purposes and may require modifications for production deployment, such as adding security measures for data communication.
